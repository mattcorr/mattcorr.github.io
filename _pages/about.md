My name is Matt Corr. I am currently working for [DXC](https://www.dxc.com) as a **Site Reliability Engineer** in sunny Brisbane, Australia.

I have created this blog to share my DevOps and automation experiences with the broader community. 
I also have some travel posts from my big New Zealand backpacking trip back in 2008 and any recent travels I have undertaken!

I have been in the IT industry for over twenty-five years now. I have worked in many industries, such as banking, transport, police and military. For about the last nine years, I have focused almost solely on the DevOps area in the Microsoft space. I frequently use products like TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, and Azure DevOps, with a good amount of PowerShell scripting, to magically glue together different systems and make my life easier.

Feel free to read more on [Linkedin](http://au.linkedin.com/in/mattcorr/), or check out my [resume](https://github.com/mattcorr/resume/blob/master/matt-corr-resume.md) if you want more details.

I am married to my wonderful and understanding Dutch wife, Femke. We have two young sons who take up most of our time.
