My name is Matt Corr, an Integration Developer working for [Mexia](http://www.mexia.com.au) in sunny Brisbane, Australia.

I have been in the IT industry for over sixteen years now. I have worked with many various industries such as banking, transport, police and military. For about the last four years I have focused solely on integration using Microsoft BizTalk. Feel free to read more on [Linkedin](http://au.linkedin.com/in/mattcorr/) if you are curious.

I have created this blog to share my experiences of using Microsoft BizTalk as well as my utilisation of Microsoft Azure and my slowly improving knowledge of PowerShell.

My other role is the administrator of internal [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) and [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) sites, so expect to see some Atlassian related content here occasionally too!

I am married to my wonderful and understanding Dutch wife Femke and we have a young son Nathan who happily takes up most spare time we might have.
We also have a new baby due in May 2017! This year is going to be pretty full on!
