My name is Matt Corr, currently working for [MOQdigital](https://www.moqdigital.com.au) as a "Solution Specialist - DevOps" in sunny Brisbane, Australia.

I have created this blog to share my DevOps and automation experiences with the wider community.

I have been in the IT industry for over twenty-two years now. I have worked with many industries such as banking, transport, police and military. For about the last five years I have focused almost solely in the DevOps area in the Microsoft space. I frequently use products like TeamCity, Octopus Deploy and Azure DevOps with a good amount of PowerShell scripting thrown in to magically glue together the different systems or just make my life easier.

Feel free to read more on [Linkedin](http://au.linkedin.com/in/mattcorr/), or check out my [resume](https://github.com/mattcorr/resume/blob/master/matt-corr-resume.md) if you want more details.

I am married to my wonderful and understanding Dutch wife Femke and we have two young sons who take up most of our time!
