As most who know me will know, I am heavily into digital photography. About a week ago I picked up a new [Canon 30D](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0602/06022114canoneos30d.asp), which will replace my aging [Canon 300D](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos300d/).

Don’t get me wrong.. the 300D is a very good camera… but the 30D. **Oh my GOD! It is awesome!**
I have a few galleries now. These can be found [here](http://photos.mattcorr.com).

The main features I like about the 30D:

* _Speed_. Digic II is just so much faster than Digic I on the 300D
* _Size_. Nice large camera to fit my massive hands. I was a bit worried about the tiny 350D.
* _LCD_. The 2’5″ LCD is larger than you think. Allows you to see photos better and more clearly.
* _Features. More features than you can throw a stick at
* _ISO Stops_. the ability to increment in 1/3 stops gives you just that little bit extra.
* _Buttons_. Three separate controls, the main dial, the quick dial and the hat switch all work together to make using the camera that much more fun and efficient.
* _Body_. Nice tough black body. Looks great and semi-pro like.

I will have fun. :)
