On the weekend I was invited out to take some shots of a friend of mine Steve, on his dirt bike.

This was also a good chance for me to play with my 30D and [the 70-300mm IS lens](https://www.canon.com.au/camera-lenses/ef-70-300mm-f-4-5-6-is-usm) on some good action shots.

The results were stunning. The speed of the 30D combined with the power of the IS produced some awesome shots..

Some sample shots:

Using the high speed shutter and some Photoshop I was able to create this:

All in all, Steve was very happy with the shots and so was I!
