This is a recent shot I took of Brisbane. Turned out alright hey? _(I thought)_

I am also currently testing the Blog This feature from a new version of [Picasa](https://picasa.google.com.au). Just seeing how well integrated it all is.
The mapping feature which links Picasa with [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/) is stunning.

I eventually might switch over my photo management software from [Picajet](https://picasa.google.com.au) to Picasa as soon as Google add a tree structure for the labels. That would rock.

I mean, Picajet is ok, but Picasa is just so slick and fast and just downright utterly cool.
