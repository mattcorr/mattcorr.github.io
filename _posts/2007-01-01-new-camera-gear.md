I figured I might make a new post for a new year :)

Well I finally got my second L glass lens... the Canon 24-70mm F/2.8 L EF lens to be exact!
If you want to see what it looks like, click here.

I love this lens. It is most likely my new main lens. with the 17-40 L now for wide angle shots and the 70-300 IS USM for long shots.

This is the new updated post!

Some sample shots so far are:

and

I look forward to using this lens in the future. More to come.
