Well I have finally upgrades from DSL to DSL2+ through [iiNet](https://www.iinet.com.au).

All I can say is about bloody time! no more max downloads of 160KB a sec and uploads of 25KB a sec.

I am now maxing out at 1.3MB down and 90KB up! Yeeha!! I am really happy. I know this is not the maximum that DSL2+ can do but since it's about the same price as my sloptus plan I am very happy.

I am impressed with iiNet so far. They have good communications and follow through. Way better than Optus's offshore support :P
