I bit the bullet and bought my own domain www.mattcorr.com a few weeks ago.

This _was_ used to link to my [smugmug site](http://www.smugmug.com/) which I had gone pro on. 

_UPDATE: 2021: Sadly I no longer have this site, so I have to update all my blog posts with references to it._

Just need to finish a few special projects first before focus completely on the smugmug site. I have a good good ideas which I am sure I will be able to implement (probably with the help from the fine folk at [dgrin.com](https://dgrin.com/))

I bought the domain from [www.joker.com](https://joker.com/) which was recommended by Smugmug. Joker appears to be based on Germany and I have found it rather painless to use. Not sure how it compares price wise, but it seems pretty sweet.

As a bonus I was easily able to setup blog.mattcorr.com to point to here.
