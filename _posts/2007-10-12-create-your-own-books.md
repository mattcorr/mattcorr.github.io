For my mothers birthday this year I used [Blurb](http://www.blurb.com/) to create a coffee table sized hard cover book about the [Bullo River](http://www.bulloriver.com/) holiday we had in late 2006.

I was impressed with the quality of the books, but the client application to create the books was a buggy Javashit piece of crap. Seriously, do they even **USE** their own client software? If they sped it up and made it less prone to screwing up the positions of photos I would like it a lot better. Other than that, it's a good service.
