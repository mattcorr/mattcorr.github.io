Recently I bought a new laptop, I am actually posting this message from it right now!

Overall I am *very very* happy with it. But it was a bit of a long drawn out process, as I wanted to get the right one from the start.

Basically you first start with the list of must have features. What I needed was the following:

* 15.4" screen
* nice keyboard
* good style
* light
* compact
* decent memory and hard drive.

I was going to go for the [Dell Inspirons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Inspiron), as we have a few of their older models and they seemed rather good and well priced. A few days before I placed the order, I went to a Dell kiosk at Chermside on a whim just to see if they had them so I could see them hands on. I was so glad I did that as the current model of Inspirons are utter shit. The keyboard quality was utter crap. SO I dropped rather quickly and had a chat to the sales staff there.

They recommended the [Dell Vostro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Vostro), which was supposed to be better. so I scoped it out and they had a good price. so I was about to order that and the I read a lot of reviews about it online and pretty much EVERYONE was saying "great lappie, but damn it is BIG and THICK and HEAVY". This was enough to put the seed of doubt in my head so I dropped the idea of getting the Vostro.

So finally I thought of getting a lappie through my work, and our supplier usually deals with HP. I previously had avoided HP like the plague especially since when they had their [dark queen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Vostro) there for 6 years of hell. But since she got booted out in 2005, HP seem to have improved [significantly](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:HPQ).

After some more research I found out their laptops are currently rather good. So I ended up buying my first HP device and am loving it immensely. It was the HP 6710b laptop. :)

So now I am more mobile, and starting to take the laptop rather than my giant desktop to LAN gaming sessions. Will this be the future? just laptops at LANs? Who knows? Time will tell.

Later!
