Just a few hours to go!

I am just finishing off the final packing before I get on a plane at 9:30am *(have to be at the airport at 6:30am though... argh..)* to fly to Auckland to meet up with my girl Femke.

We will then travel as backpackers through New Zealand on both north and south islands and explore the wonderfully photographic country together!

It should be the most fascinating time of my life. Well I better finish off the packing!

Will post more articles soon. Stay tuned!
