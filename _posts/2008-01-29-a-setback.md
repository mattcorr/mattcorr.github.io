After the Auckland Coast to Coast we drove to the supermarket in our new car. 

After a quick shop we got back to the car and I put the key in to unlock it and noticed that the lock fell inside the car and was loose. **Argh!**
I gave the keys to Fem who managed to unlock her door but also pushed her lock into her door as well. **Double Argh!**
So now if we lock the car the only way we can get back in is by unlocking the boot and crawling in to open a back door that way.

_Sigh...._

So now we have postpone the departure to Wellington until the locks are fixed. And since today (Monday) is a public holiday in Auckland we have to wait until tomorrow before we can get it checked out by a mechanic. Plus more cost on the initial car repairs... frustrating but not much we can do about it.
