On the 8th of February, Fem and I said goodbye to Jeff, Cath, Jarrod and Jack and boarded a boat with Magnum to get to the south island.

We had plans to do a 5 day tramp on the Abel Tasman starting on the 10th, so after arriving at Picton after a 3 hour boat voyage we drove straight to Nelson.

After spending one night in Nelson, we drove to Marahau to get ready for the mighty [Abel Tasman Coastal Track](http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/nelson-tasman/places/abel-tasman-national-park/things-to-do/tracks/abel-tasman-coast-track/).
