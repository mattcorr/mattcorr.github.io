On February 24th, we left for Franz Josef and I would have to say we were spoilt by the stunning drive from Westport to Greymouth as the drive from Greymouth to Franz Josef was rather dull and desolate.

There were some points of interest though. Near Harihari we saw where there first solo flight from Australia to New Zealand ended _(or rather crash landed)_.

It was only in the last 40 minutes of the 2.5 hour trip when we came close to the Southern Alps of New Zealand that the scenery improved immensely!
