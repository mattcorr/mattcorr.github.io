Don't worry! you are at the right page! :)

I have just decided to change my blogging server from [blogger](https://www.blogger.com) to [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/).

Why did I change? Well, it was rather painful editing and embedding photos via blogger. But I didn't know of anything better. A few days ago I visited the [wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) site and trialed out their free blogs. I was totally stunned at how much better, flexible and more powerful the interface was. Plus I could also import in all of my blogger posts seamlessly (as you can see below).

Some of the killer features include:

* Flexible width columns- no more reading a blog in a tiny 400 pixel wide column which has always been a pet peeve of mine
* Media Library - I can manage my uploaded photos separately to the articles themselves, and even upload whole directories of photos if needed. (blogger was one at a time and embedded in articles so they were too static)
* Post editor is much better
* Page designer is more powerful and customisable
and on and on....

If you like or hate the new format let me know via the comments below.

More updates coming soon!
