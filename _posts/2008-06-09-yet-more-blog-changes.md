Hello again!

So what have I done now?  I have now some web hosting thanks to the nice chaps over at [Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/). So now I am hosting the blog in an area that is fully controlled by myself. Wahoo!

So what does all this mean for you my readers? Nothing major really. The blog is still at http://blog.mattcorr.com. However I now have no restrictions, as there was a few when the blog was hosted at https://www.wordpress.com. I will be able to try out some new plug-ins and widgets and themes myself to also enhance the viewing experience both for you and myself.

So expect to seem some changes around here. Not all will be visible, but it should be interesting, nonetheless!
