We have not had much snow here in Christchurch. This is something I would like to see as I have not really been in or walked around in the snow before.

On the 5th of July, we were out for some shopping and a movie and noticed it was pretty much a blizzard outside! I was keen to go outside and check it out after the movie.

Driving back home was indeed a fun experience. We had to slow right down and visibility was very low. Unfortunately, it died down by the time we got back to the apartment so I donâ€™t have any shots of the storm itself.

I did manage to take a photo of our window so you could see the build-up of ice.

Fem also used the laptop a bit later on and she needed my thick sleeping bag to keep herself warm.

It certainly was a cold day!
