Wow. itâ€™s been over a year since I have touched this site.

Does this mean I am not active any more? This is not the case.

I guess I am more active on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/mattcorr) and [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/mattcorr) than this blog. _(for now anyway)_

Femke and I are now engaged! This wedding is in September 2011.

Her parents are over visiting from Holland. We are all gearing up for the holidays!

Summer is not as hot as last year which is **wonderful**!

Chat soon!
