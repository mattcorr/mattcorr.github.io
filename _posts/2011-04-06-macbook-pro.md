Most of you already know that on my personal PC side, I have switched from PC to Mac. After using an iPhone for over a year by that time I was curious about exploring the “other side” and see what the development environment is like.

It started in February 2010 when I dipped my toes in the water and bought a [Macbook 13″](http://www.apple.com/au/macbook/). It quickly became my main computer and I grew very interested and keen on the mac way.

Now over a year later I have upgraded from the Macbook to a new [Macbook Pro 15″](http://www.apple.com/au/macbookpro/). I am totally loving the the speed and power of this system and am looking forward to using it for a very long time.

I know a lot of PC people still point out the initial cost of a Mac as a major negative. Sure it’s expensive, but the quality of the hardware with the interface and “get out of your way” nature of OS X makes it well worth it.

Also since I still work with PCs at work, I switch between the two every day. [Windows 7](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/home) is a very capable OS but the quality of the laptops is noticeably  inferior!

But as with all flamewars people have biases and prefer to have sides. Some prefer Windows and it works for them. fair enough. I just prefer the Mac :)

Xcode here I come!
