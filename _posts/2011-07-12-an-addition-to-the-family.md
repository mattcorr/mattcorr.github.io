I donâ€™t know if many or any people are still following this blog? However I do just want to proudly announce that my future wife to be Femke is now about 8 weeks pregnant with our first child!

The child is due around the 22nd of March 2012. I will try to post updates on this blog as time goes on so people who do follow can keep track.

First a wedding in four weeks from now, then the final visa approval for Femke and then preparation for our first child! What exciting times!
