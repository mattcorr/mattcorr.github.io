Tomorrow is Femkeâ€™s last day at her work for about 9 months!

She is currently due on the 18th of March, and is really looking forward to just resting and getting ready for the arrival of Junior around that time!

We know our child will be a boy! We have a few names shortlisted but we had trouble coming up with ones that we both liked. Funnily enough we had no trouble getting girls names sorted out. I recall doing this a few months ago before we knew the gender of the baby and we had two of them sorted out within 30 mins!

I will be taking five weeks off work for paternity leave, so it will be a great time for us to bond with our child.

We are both excited and nervous at the same time!

March 2012 is going to be a very very exciting month!
