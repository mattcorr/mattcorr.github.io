We are now at week 41 of Femkeâ€™s pregnancy.

She has been home for over four weeks now and is pretty bored. She has cleaned the house pretty well but overall is not going overboard with the nesting urge that we are told a lot of women go through prior to birth.

However she would love for the little guy to just come out! But still he is just not moving. So on Wednesday (28th March) if there is still no sign of labour, then we will have to go to hospital for an induction.

Femke was really hoping for an all natural birth.I believe this is still possible but we just require a small nudge from the midwives!

I have a feeling he next blog post will be a good one with plenty of pictures!
