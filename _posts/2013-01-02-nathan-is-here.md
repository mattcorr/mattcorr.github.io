I have been really really slack with this site hey?

Based on the previous article, I can say that Femke gave birth on 30 March 2012 to **Nathan Auke Ross Corr**.

He is now just over 9 months old _(wow time flies hey?)_ and is an absolutely gorgeous, adorable baby and is the jewel of our lives.

We are now planning a trip to the Netherlands in June of this year. It should be a blast!
