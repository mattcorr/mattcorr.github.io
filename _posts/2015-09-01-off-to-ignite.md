This year [Mexia](http://www.mexia.com.au) are sending several co-workers and I to the [Microsoft Ignite conference](https://msignite.nz) to be held in Auckland, New Zealand.

I am glad to be back in the beautiful New Zealand country. You can see all the photos from my last (and really long!) trip here in 2008 from this [link](http://photos.mattcorr.com/New-Zealand).

My schedule is packed for the next 4 days so let the learning/networking commence!
