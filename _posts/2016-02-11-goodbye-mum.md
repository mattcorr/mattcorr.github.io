This is very hard one for me to write.

On the 13th of January 2016, without any warning, my mother had a heart attack late at night.

Despite the best efforts of hospital staff over the next 2 weeks, she was not able to wake up.

She passed away peacefully on the 2nd of February 2016.

Her funeral was on the 8th of February 2016 and it was a very moving service and a worthwhile tribute to a wonderful person. There would have been about 200-300 people there.

Mum was taken far too soon and too suddenly. Her two grandchildren have been robbed of a kind, passionate, loving, warm, considerate, gentle grandmother. Her two adult sons just want to still be able to talk to her and give her big hugs. I am sure my father misses her terribly as even after 44 years of marriage they both still behaved like teenagers at times.

I will miss you Mum.

I love you.
