## New Direction
While I have previously used the ghost blogging engine which is certainly a great place to base yourself, I found the limitations of hosting on Azure and the manual updating process a bit too combersome for my liking.
One solution was to have ghost host it for me, but the $20USD cost per month seems a bit excessive for me.

I did ask around and there seemed to be a fair bit of love for the Jekyll + GitHub pages approach to personal blog hosting.

This is now my attempt to migrate to this process.

### New Theme
The default Minim theme that comes wth Jekyll is pretty good, ut I felt I needed something more.
I stumbled across the Minimal MIstakes theme and found that really suitable!

## Sample stuff.

So lets see how this looks!

We can do *formatting* in **various** different ~~ways~~

We can have sample `inline code strings` in part of sentences.

We can emphasis paragraphs of text to make them standout more!
{: .notice}

Back to boring old text

But YES we can even make them different colours! (blue)
{: .notice--info} 

But YES we can even make them different colours! (yellow)
{: .notice--warning} 

But YES we can even make them different colours! (green)
{: .notice--success} 

We can Quote other pages

> This is some profound statement

from [this site](http://www.cnn.com)

We can even have block codes!

``` PowerShell
Write-Host "this is a demo here" -NoNewLine
# some commands look like this
$variable = Get-Command -Verb New -Command $results
```

# Heading 1
Some text

## Heading 2
More text

### Heading 3
Text again. this heading is still useful. but I dont think we will go any smaller.

#### Heading 4
Hmm this heading looks **smaller** than the text!? I dom't think we will use `H4`.
