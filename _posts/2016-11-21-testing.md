# First Heading
This is some *sample* text _italics_ in this **folder**.

``` powershell
# Some code here
Write-Host "this is a test" - noNewLine
$variable = Get-Value -param $variable
# Another comment
```

## Second Heading 
It can also display `inline code` as well.

Some lists:

* one
* two
* three

## Ordered lists
Can be handled too.
1. test
2. more tests
3. even more.

Can we do strike through? ~~like these words~~ as well?
And quote?

> this is a quote right here.
