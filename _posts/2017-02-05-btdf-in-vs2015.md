## Summary
The [BizTalk Deployment Framework](https://biztalkdeployment.codeplex.com/) tool (BTDF) is a very useful tool for packaging up BizTalk applications for deployment to an environment.
We have used it many times across various clients for all their BizTalk solutions and it works very well. (Especially for [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com) based automated deployments.)

Now with the release of [BizTalk 2016](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt670742.aspx), the IDE is now Visual Studio 2015.

BTDF is currently not _fully_ supported in Visual Studio 2015. **Yet.** 

**So when then?** There is now an RC1 of V5.7 of BTDF that is available [here](http://biztalkdeployment.codeplex.com/releases/view/630373). Thomas is working away on completing functionality in this version.
{: .notice--info}

## So what can we do in the meantime?
If you are like us and about to start on BizTalk 2016 development and need the BTDF to work NOW, then follow the steps below.

There are some useful comments on the [BTDF forums here](https://biztalkdeployment.codeplex.com/discussions/654830). We used this as a base.

## Pre-requisites
The following needs to be in place on your local developer VM first:

* Install [PowerShell 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50395)
* Download [version 5.7 RC1 of BTDF](http://biztalkdeployment.codeplex.com/releases/view/630373)
* Download this [workaround package](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/187700/BizTalk/BTDF-WorkAround.zip) and extract it locally on your dev VM somewhere

**TIP:** I had previously said you needed the [Powershell GAC](https://github.com/LTruijens/powershell-gac) module. This is no longer required, however still recommended you download it as it is a very useful tool.

## Installation Process

**WARNING:** This section was updated on 07/02/2017 when I found out that BTDF v5.7 RC1 was released.
{: .notice--danger}

Install the v5.7 RC1 of BTDF


## Visual Studio 2015 usage
While the MSI is installed, its not integrated into Visual Studio 2015. So we will have to "kludge" that for now.

To do this, create your BizTalk Solution in Visual Studio 2015.

Add a solution Folder to the root of the Solution

![](/assets/images/2017/02/2017-02-05_16-57-42.png)

Open the Package Manager Console inside of Visual Studio and run this PowerShell script.

**TIP:** You can get to the Package Manager Console by **Tools-> Nuget Package Manager -> Package Manager Console**

#Save the solution
$solution.SaveAs($solution.FullName)
```
Use the following parameters

1. **BTDFTemplateFolder** - same as the parameter above
2. **ParentSolutionFolder** - name of the parent solution folder. I used "solutionItems". Your standard might be something else.

This will copy files from the Workaround folder to your solution, add them to the Solution Folder.
The `Deployment.btdfproj` file is also updated with the name of the Solution and the GUIDS are generated.

**TIP:** If you prefer the Visual Studio structure to be different, feel free to edit the script above.

## How to use it?

The commands folder (highlighted in yellow above) work as a way to call the BTDF commands that would have appeared in the toolbar.

If you have an extension (like [Command Line](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.OpenCommandLine)) that allows for executing of cmd files, you can right click and run the commands.

![](/assets/images/2017/02/2017-02-05_17-16-01.png)

The next step is to edit the `Deployment.btdfproj` file as per your usual process.

**NOTE:** This is still intended as a temporary fix until an official version of BTDF with Visual Studio 2015 support is released!

If there are any issues with this or you can think of some improvements, please let me know.
