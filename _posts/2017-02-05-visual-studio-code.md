We all have software tools and utilities we take with us from job to job. These preferred tool make us more productive and are fun to use.

## Text Editors
Text editors are usually a very religious topic. Everyone holds their own choice close to their hearts.
I have used a few over the years. The main ones include: 

* [UltraEdit](http://www.ultraedit.com/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

### Time for a new one
I had thought that Sublime Text was the ultimate. Don't get me wrong, it is very nice and fast.
However I started watching the development of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by Microsoft pretty closely not long after the first version was released.
As each new version came out, the application incrementally improved.

The main features I have found useful so far, include:

* Multi-platform 
* Free _(duh, but this helps getting it installed at clients sites)_
* Great plugin support
* Git integration
* Active development _(sorry sublime)_
* Great Markdown support _(version 1.9 has great improvements in this area)_
* Excellent Powershell support

It is now the editor of choice for me and I now use it for creating posts for this blog! :)

So if you have not had a chance to look at it, I would highly recommend you [check it out](https://code.visualstudio.com/)!
