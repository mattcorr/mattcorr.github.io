A few days ago at 9:08am on the 15th of May, 2017, my second son was born!

Welcome to the world **Peter**!

![Hello Peter!](https://mcblogfiles.blob.core.windows.net/images/2017/05/IMG_0113.JPG)

He weighed in at 4.043kg and was measured at 55cm long.

Both mother and son are doing well.

After a few days of recovery and observation by the great hospital staff, my wife and newborn came home yesterday.

We also got a [new car](http://www.kia.com/au/cars/carnival.html) 2 days ago for the extra space our family now needs and my wife's mother arrived yesterday from the Netherlands for a few weeks.

This has been the most hectic week in a long time!!
