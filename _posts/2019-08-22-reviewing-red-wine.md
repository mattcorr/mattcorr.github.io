I sometimes like to drink whiskey at night. It tastes nice and relaxes me and it seems to help me get more solid sleep.

While this is pleasant, I thought it might be a good idea to start trying out some red wine as well _(not in the same night though!)_. There seems to be a fair bit of [research out there](https://time.com/4070762/red-wine-resveratrol-diabetes/) that says drinking red wine _in moderation_ is actually good for you!

I thought this blog would be a good place to keep track of the wines I have tried and to provide some informal reviews. 

NOTE: I am in no way an expert wine taste tester nor claim to be, so take the reviews with a grain of salt!

|Wine|Type|Year|Rating|Review|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|The Stag Cool Climate|Shiraz|2017|6/10|Not too bad, had a bit of a strong bitey taste. Not sure I would get again|
|Pepperjacks|Shiraz|2017|8/10|Pretty good actually. Obviously given the name, a noticeable hint of pepper in the flavour, but very smooth. Would drink again|
|Jacob's Creek Double Barrel|Shiraz|2016|4/10|This took me by surprise. I have had Jacob's Creek before and always been happy with the taste. This one seems not as fruity as I previously remembered, but the taste is okay. Better than the the Stag. But this one is is also excessively dry. Make sure you drink a lot of water before going to bed or you are likely to wake up with a very dry mouth. Maybe its the double barrel effect? |

More wines coming soon!

I had some recommendations from friends which include Pinot Noir and Merlot as it seems I might lean more towards the fruity and sweeter versions rather than the dry shiraz. I'll give them a try. 

Are there are red wines you think I should check out? Let me know in the comments below!
